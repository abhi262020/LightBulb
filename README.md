# LightBulb
 In this state machine model, the light bulb operates as a simple system with three distinct states: Off, On, and Broken. Each state represents a different physical condition of the bulb, and the transitions between these states are triggered by events such as turning the bulb on, turning it off, or breaking the bulb.
